    <h2>What is a blog?</h2>
    <p id= "myid">In 1997, Jorn Barger, blogger for Robot Wisdom, coined the term "weblog", which was meant to describe his process
        for "logging the web" as he surfed the internet.
        The term "weblog" was shortened to "blog" in 1999, by programmer Peter Merholz.</p>
